### Running in Development

```bash
# Run with auto-reload for development
uv run python run_dev.py

# Or using uvicorn directly
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Testing

Run the test suite to verify everything is working:

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run tests with verbose output
uv run pytest -v

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest test_api.py -v
```

### Code Quality

Format and lint your code:

```bash
# Format code with black
uv run black .

# Sort imports with isort
uv run isort .

# Run both formatting tools
uv run black . && uv run isort .
```
